RISC-V Summit Europe brings together developers, architects, technical decision
and policy makers from across the European RISC-V ecosystem. Attendees from
academia, research, SMEs, industry, and open source communities will come
together to exchange knowledge, ideas, technologies, and research, shaping the
future of RISC-V computing in Europe.

Taking place from June 24-28, 2024, the event will have a single track of
keynotes, invited and selected talks, alongside an exhibition showcasing the
latest developments across industry and research, including technology
demonstrations and poster sessions. Submissions are invited either for the
**Research and Development** sessions or the **Industry** sessions. Any question
whether a submission should apply for Research and Development or Industry
sessions should be asked to the PC chairs at riscv-europe2024_pc@softconf.com
before submitting. Please note, an abstract may not be submitted to both
sessions. 

Important dates:

- Abstract submission deadline: Monday, March 15th, 2024, AoE (Anywhere on Earth).
- Author notification: Monday, April 29th, 2024.
- Final abstract PDF and slides deadline: Thursday, May 31st, 2024 AoE.
- Poster PDF deadline: June 14, 2024 AoE.
- RISC-V Summit Europe: June 24-28, 2024, Munich.

The Steering Committee aims to provide a limited budget for stipends. More
information will be available on the conference website before the submission
deadline. 

## Research and Development (R&D) Sessions

We invite submissions related to RISC-V addressing the following technical topics of interest:

- Security and functional safety 
- Energy efficiency and green computing
- High-performance computing
- Embedded systems, IoT, edge computing
- Automotive
- Cloud computing
- Open-source hardware and open silicon
- Operating system and software ecosystem
- Compilation and code optimization
- Open EDA tools
- Verification and formal methods
- Systems-on-Chip, cores, RISC-V ISA extensions, accelerators, peripherals
- Hardware/software co-design
- RISC-V related educational activities
- Any other topic related to RISC-V and open stack (hardware or software)

Submissions for the Research and Development sessions are for *blind review* by
the Program Committee. Please, do not include any author information in the
abstract. Submissions must have a strong focus on technical content outlining
for example:

- timely research advances,
- success stories,
- technical introduction to new technologies, 
- experiences of contributions to, or adoption of RISC-V hardware and software in commercial, open-source or education environments.

### Submission Format for R&D sessions (blind):

The R&D submissions should be provided as a two page extended abstract. Abstract
template and instructions for submission will be available on the Summit website
at https://riscv-europe.org.

The committees will accept most contributions as posters and selected
submissions for short or long presentations. 

Accepted abstracts, slides, and posters will be published on the event page,
together with presentations, which will be recorded. The Program Committee will
ask for the **poster and/or presentation slides three weeks before the event**
to confirm the acceptance at the according deadlines. 

Suitable research & development submissions by industry will also be recommended
for the talks slots of the industry sessions.


## Industry Session

We will also reserve a limited number of presentation slots to welcome
submissions detailing large-scale research efforts, announcements, or commercial
applications and products based on RISC-V, which are new or have recently become
ready for real world deployment.  This includes for example the following
community-interest and trend-oriented topics:

- Technical presentations for new commercial products
- Technical presentations for new applications
- Technical success stories
- Policies, strategies, business and industry trends
- Overview presentations of publicly funded projects
- Spin-off experiences: from research to industry
- Important announcements related to RISC-V

Areas of interest include:

- HPC and Data Center
- Automotive
- Embedded / IoT
- Mobile
- AI / ML
- Software and Ecosystem

### Submission Format for Industry sessions (non blind)

Submissions can be any length up to a two-page abstract. To improve chances of
acceptance you should give a good impression of the content and important
take-away points that can be expected from the presentation. Abstract template
and instructions for submission will be available on the Summit website at
https://riscv-europe.org.

As it is hard to hide authors for this type of contributions, submissions for
the Industry sessions are for **non-blind** review by the Industry Session
Committee. Make sure to name authors and their affiliation and please include a
short bio of the lead presenter.  

These submissions should highlight product RISC-V markets, policies, strategies,
business and industry trends, or present publicly funded projects of interest to
the RISC-V and open hardware community. Please avoid sales or marketing
pitches. 

Accepted abstracts, slides, and posters will be published on the event page,
together with presentations, which will be recorded. The Program Committee will
ask for the **poster and/or presentation slides three weeks before the event**
to confirm the acceptance.
