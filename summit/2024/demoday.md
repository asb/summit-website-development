Calling all universities and research institutions passionate about RISC-V
technology! We're thrilled to invite you to our RISC-V University Demo Day,
where academia meets innovation in the realm of open-source hardware and
software.

RISC-V has emerged as a leading architecture, offering flexibility, scalability,
and openness like never before. In Europe, universities and research
institutions have been at the forefront of RISC-V research, driving
groundbreaking advancements that have the potential to shape the future of
computing.

This demo day is your opportunity to showcase your cutting-edge RISC-V research
results, whether they are hardware prototypes, software demonstrators, or
innovative applications. Whether you're exploring novel RISC-V processor
designs, optimizing software stacks for RISC-V architectures, or pushing the
boundaries of RISC-V-based IoT devices, we want to hear from you!

By participating in the RISC-V University Demo Day, you'll not only have the
chance to share your work with fellow researchers, industry professionals, and
enthusiasts but also contribute to building excitement and momentum around
RISC-V adoption in various industries.

Let's come together to unlock the full potential of RISC-V and shape the future
of computing, one demo at a time!

### Guidelines

- The university demo day is limited to universities and research institutions
- Demonstrators can be results from joint projects with industry, but the focus must be clearly on the academic partner(s)
- Presentations are limited to an overview slide
- The actual demo should showcase your great results, either around a chip, FPGA or software
- Viewers should understand the relevance of your demonstrator to the growing RISC-V ecosystem

### Submission

To create the best experience of this unique opportunity, we require you to
share a brief video of your proposed demonstration. This does not have to be of
very high quality and be the final demonstration, but it is important for us to
understand maturity of the demonstrator and the learning from your
demonstration. Just use your powerful smartphone to show us what you plan to
present!

The deadline for submissions is **May 28, 2024**. Notification will be no later
than **June 5, 2024**.
