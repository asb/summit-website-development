[RISC-V](https://riscv.org), the open standard [instruction set architecture (ISA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture), is enabling a range of new applications and research that will define the future of computing in Europe. The region has been central to RISC-V's success, with one-third of RISC-V's global community based in Europe.

*RISC-V Summit Europe* takes place from Monday 24th to Friday 28th June, 2024. The combination of strong industrial and academic communities is key to the success of RISC-V in Europe, and for this reason the conference is designed to help attendees to explore both commercial and research applications.

*RISC-V Summit Europe* is an opportunity not to be missed. Come to Munich to be part of the new wave of European computing innovation!
