To make the best of the constrained resources of MCUs, Antmicro’s Kenning open source AI/ML framework was extended with a bare-metal runtime backend, enabling use with RISC-V based devices that cannot - or don’t need to - run Linux. Kenning enables you to seamlessly develop, train, optimize and deploy ML models on various embedded targets and can automatically convert the model format between the most popular AI frameworks and optimize models for their target runtime. The metrics from the deployed models can be utilized to monitor various aspects of processing, from machine resource usage to result quality.  To further improve the developer experience, Kenning has been integrated with Renode, Antmicro’s open source, deterministic simulation framework. The integration of Kenning and Renode enables a hardware-less development flow and allows for complete insight into model execution and AI accelerator utilization. Renode provides a fully automated, reproducible execution environment, allowing a CI-based development of embedded models, optimization libraries, and AI accelerators.

They can experience difficulties in obtaining appropriate analog IP for specific processes and foundries, and struggle with the integration of multiple analog IP blocks from different vendors into their systems. The integration of analog and digital at the mixed-signal boundary poses a particularly daunting and resource-intensive task, requiring specialized knowledge and tools. To address these challenges, Agile Analog present an innovative analog IP subsystem for RISC-V applications. This subsystem is designed to be customizable, and digitally wrapped, offering a novel solution that tackles many of the issues encountered by SoC designers with existing solutions. Specifically, Agile Analog’s subsystem includes a comprehensive set of analog IP components essential for a typical battery-powered IoT system, including a power management unit (PMU), a sleep management unit (SMU), and data converters. These IP components undergo thorough verification in both analog and digital environments, ensuring their reliability and performance, plus seamlessly connect to the MCU’s peripheral bus and are supplied with a SystemVerilog model, facilitating their integration into an existing SoC’s verification environment.

tue,11:30-12:15,Keynotes,keynote,,11:45,"Brett Cline, Codasip","RISC-V customization, HW/SW co-optimization, and custom compute","If you optimize your software for a general-purpose core there is a substantial risk that your algorithms are executed inefficiently and therefore run slowly. You can address this by creating fixed-function circuits designed to perform a specific set of operations. These hardware functions can be extremely fast, but because they are hard coded, it is difficult to modify or update them. So how can you achieve flexibility and performance? By combining both approaches. A key benefit of RISC-V customization is that you can create custom instructions tailored to your specific application needs.

To pick custom instructions correctly and create efficient implementations, software and hardware teams need to collaborate. By starting work earlier on processor customization, the software team can start developing their critical algorithms and uncover much sooner those potential gains that could not be achieved if the hardware was already frozen.  We call this Custom Compute, and its benefits extend beyond performance and energy efficiency. Custom Compute can also enable organizations to improve security by adding security features at the heart of the processor. A closer collaboration between hardware and software teams, supported by a strong methodology and by efficient tools, is the future standard of system design.",,,2023-06-06-11h45-Brett-CLINE-slides.pdf

Before Google, he was at Mozilla Research, initially contributing to the Servo browser project and directing the integration of Rust into Firefox and the partner ecosystem. Later, he led Mozilla’s AR and VR work, shipping software and building OEM relationships on many different devices. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Chicago in 2013.
