In each of these, the growth of RISC-V is forecast to be driven by increases in the volume and value of what Omdia terms ‘applied intelligence’, encompassing processors for AI, connectivity, and rich embedded applications. This talk will present Omdia’s findings and forecasts for RISC-V in these markets, as well as the firm’s forecast for processors by application.",,,
