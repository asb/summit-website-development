This newfound freedom however, opens up challenges in the areas of exploration, verification, validation and deployment of the design, as well as the team expertise needed to deliver a working product on schedule.

In this presentation, we will explore how Siemens, with collaboration with our RISC-V ecosystem partners, and customers, has been able to eliminate these new sources of risk and improve schedule predictability for RISC-V based designs. From the earliest stages of design, through functional validation and production deployment, Siemens’ solutions support RISC-V. Our long history of working with our customers on both standard and custom processor designs and SoCs translates directly to RISC-V work. 

Siemens EDA is dedicated to helping companies engineer a smarter future faster with its industry-leading portfolio of EDA software, hardware and services. Technology support specifically targeted to RISC-V includes these Siemens EDA platforms: Veloce, Questa, Catapult, and Tessent.","Since graduating with a degree in electrical engineering in 1997 from Friedrich-Alexander University in Erlangen, Thomas Heurung has been assisting customers in solving various challenges in industrial applications. His first engagements were with the development of electrical systems for automobiles and airplanes, embedded software for distributed control systems, and eventually moved on to the development of complex electronic systems and components.
After transitioning from Synopsys to Mentor Graphics in 2004, which became part of Siemens AG in 2017 and is now known as Siemens Electronic Design Automation, he held various responsibilities such as global business development and establishing and leading technical sales in Europe and India for the Capital and Volcano product lines.

AI/ML and Embedded Vision architectures present unique challenges in data transport architectures to procure all relevant data from off-chip DRAMs and efficiently store and transport them in caches to allow efficient computing on SoCs and systems of chiplets. 

These challenges directly translate into specific requirements for NoC implementation, impacting performance, power consumption, and cost, efficiently addressing the challenges posed by what the industry calls the ""memory wall"" – the much faster improvement of processor vs. DRAM memory access speed.
