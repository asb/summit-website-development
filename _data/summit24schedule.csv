This newfound freedom however, opens up challenges in the areas of exploration, verification, validation and deployment of the design, as well as the team expertise needed to deliver a working product on schedule.

In this presentation, we will explore how Siemens, with collaboration with our RISC-V ecosystem partners, and customers, has been able to eliminate these new sources of risk and improve schedule predictability for RISC-V based designs. From the earliest stages of design, through functional validation and production deployment, Siemens’ solutions support RISC-V. Our long history of working with our customers on both standard and custom processor designs and SoCs translates directly to RISC-V work. 

Siemens EDA is dedicated to helping companies engineer a smarter future faster with its industry-leading portfolio of EDA software, hardware and services. Technology support specifically targeted to RISC-V includes these Siemens EDA platforms: Veloce, Questa, Catapult, and Tessent.","Since graduating with a degree in electrical engineering in 1997 from Friedrich-Alexander University in Erlangen, Thomas Heurung has been assisting customers in solving various challenges in industrial applications. His first engagements were with the development of electrical systems for automobiles and airplanes, embedded software for distributed control systems, and eventually moved on to the development of complex electronic systems and components.
After transitioning from Synopsys to Mentor Graphics in 2004, which became part of Siemens AG in 2017 and is now known as Siemens Electronic Design Automation, he held various responsibilities such as global business development and establishing and leading technical sales in Europe and India for the Capital and Volcano product lines.

In this presentation we will demonstrate Sonata's features including the CHERIoT IbexⓇ core and a variety of peripherals (I2C, SPI, GPIO, PWM, UART, and DMA). Sonata has been designed by lowRISC, as part of the Sunburst Project, and is fully open source (available on GitHub under an Apache 2.0 license). It is designed for use on Artix-7 FPGAs and specifically targets the Sonata board designed by NewAE which we'll be using for this demonstration.

As the adoption of RISC-V grows, there is an increasing emphasis on enhancing security features in ASIC and FPGA designs. The protection of sensitive data, including encryption keys, passwords, and biometric information, is paramount, as these are prime targets for security breaches that can lead to costly, damaging, and embarrassing consequences. Challenges in security verification that must be addressed include ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and inversion, as well as mitigating the exploitation of sneak paths, addressing inefficient verification flows, and managing the added complexity. In this context, formal technology stands out as the sole method that guarantees the security requirements of datapaths are fulfilled. Our methodology introduces a high degree automation to expedite the security verification process, showcasing its applicability and debugging prowess in a RISC-V implementation, specifically with OpenTitan. The paper will present our findings, providing detailed explanations and runtime information, highlighting our approach's effectiveness in enhancing security verification.",,,
