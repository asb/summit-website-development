,,,invited,,,"Edward Wilford, Omdia",The intelligent wave: How a growth in advanced and accelerated compute will drive adoption of RISC-V ,"Research firm Omdia’s recent report, RISC-V Processors Market Tracker, examines the projected growth of the ISA in six key verticals; automotive, communications, consumer, enterprise, industrial, and mobile. In each of these, the growth of RISC-V is forecast to be driven by increases in the volume and value of what Omdia terms ‘applied intelligence’, encompassing processors for AI, connectivity, and rich embedded applications. This talk will present Omdia’s findings and forecasts for RISC-V in these markets, as well as the firm’s forecast for processors by application.
